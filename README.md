# TMF662_EntityCatalog
TM Forum Open APIs (Apache 2.0) Entity Catalog API

The entity catalog is intended to provide any SID entity to consumers via a catalog, with its specification and
policy providing governance over its content. The API provides managements of the entity specifications and their
associations thru CRUD operations.

The Admin swagger file provides a schema with the complete set of operations to manage a catalog while the regular
swagger file provides a schema with only those set of operations that a regular user needs to use a catalog.

To access this API; (the Specification, Postman Collection, Swagger file, Swagger-UI, 
Reference Implementation, Conformance Profile, and CTK) go to the Open API table at:
